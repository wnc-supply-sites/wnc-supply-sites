phase (1) will be to update the current website offering to be a fully fledged disaster relief product. By 'fully fledged', we want to include volunteering opportunities/events. We will also need to resolve how we want the dispatch/admin components to look (currently they exist in airtable and that will not scale)
phase (2) build a companion app



It looks like there will be a good bit of website work before we finally ever need to involve an app. 
AFAIK, the app and websites are going to be companions. 
The app will at minimum allow us to replace SMS message confirmations to be fully automatic based upon a phone's location. 
The app will need to "phone home" back to the website for some things. I'm pointing out that the two (app & website) will never be quite fully independent. 
We need to keep in mind to what extent we will require someone to use the website, or require them to use the app. 
We could build the app to be a true companion, to make everything in the website just easier to use, rather than being like "okay, now you have to have the app to do X"; 
or we could require the app to be used for everything and the website would be little more than a database.
