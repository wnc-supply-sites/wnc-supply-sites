Webapp for Hurricane Helene disaster relief. The website provides
a search and simple inventory management interface for supply sites.
This allows supply sites to indicate their needs, urgent & surplus
items. Ultimately the goal is to allow for supply items to be redistributed
from sites that have too much, to those that need those items.

## Contributing

- Need system/linux admin
- Pull requests are welcome, open an issue first if you plan to contribute
  so we can coordinate.
- Need help with data entry, supply drivers, dispatchers & communication
  coordinators

## Ops

See the [ops-docs](docs/ops.md)

## Development 

### Quick Start - Backend Dev
- clone the code
- install intellij
- install Java23
- right click the webapp/build.gradle file & select 'link project'
- install postgres
- run: `./schema/run-flyway.sh`
- Run `SuppliesDatabaseApplication.java`
  - in run configuration, set the environment variable: `WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret`

### Quick Start - Frontend Dev
- clone the code
- open any of the .html file in a web browser
- update the corresponding HTML, CSS & JS files; check-in & push

### Quick Start - dockerized

- install docker
- clone the code
- cd to the project directory
- run: `docker compose up`

### Branching Strategy & Workflow

- Ship, Show, Ask: https://martinfowler.com/articles/ship-show-ask.html

- Keep a linear history, do not push merge commits to master!
  - use merge with fast forward only or rebase


### Local Setup

- install postgres to your machine (bare-metal)
   - ideally this would be a postgres on docker. If you get that setup, please update these README instructions
- There is a docker-compose.yml that is fully working. That can be used for a database.
  If using that, kindly update this Readme with those working instructions
- Create databases. Two of them. Login and user are same for both. One is 'wnc_helene' which will be used 
  when running the app locally and accessing via "localhost:8080", the other DB, 'wnc_helene_test' is used 
  by unit tests.


```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
create database wnc_helene;
create user wnc_helene with password 'wnc_helene';
alter database wnc_helene owner to wnc_helene;

create database wnc_helene_test;
create user wnc_helene_test with password 'wnc_helene';
alter database wnc_helene_test owner to wnc_helene;
```

- Run flyway to excecute migration files. A helper script is in `schema/`
- To redo the 'test' database from scratch, run `./recreate-db.sh`. 
  Edit & modify the script to recreate `wnc_helene` from scratch.

#### Docker

- if on Mac, be sure to go to settings, file & folder permissions, and allow 'Docker' to access 'Documents' folder
- if on Mac, be sure to configure docker to be installed as a system resource
- TODO: docker install steps

Access local DB (on docker)
```
docker exec -it helene-distro-database-1 bash
su postgres
psql
\c wnc_helene_test
```

#### Access local DB (on bare-metal)
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
\c wnc_helene
```

- The databases will have empty data. Example data can be found in `src/test/resources/TestData.sql`

- Finally, the app can be launched via Intellj IDE, main class is `SuppliesDatabaseApplication.java`
  - The app can also be likely be run via gradle `./gradlew bootRun` (not well tested/vetted, but should work)

- A few environment variables need to be set. This can be done in the run config in IntelliJ:
  - WEBHOOK_SECRET  (can be set to any value)

### Development - Running unit tests

- Tests run primarily through IntelliJ IDE, right click 'test' folder & run
- Test can be run with gradle as well `./gradlew test`


### Tech Stack
 
- springboot
- JDBI
- postgres
- mustache
- vanilla JS
- aspectJ (for testing)
- gradle

### Tech Stack Non-Choices

Do not bring these frameworks in, these frameworks are intentionally rejected:
- spring security (if we do integration with a system that uses OAuth2 tokens, like
  FB, or google, then perhaps yes)
- JPA
- guava (just avoid, favor to copy/paste their implementations into a Util class)


### Project Layout

- `webapp/`
  - This is the interesting part that is the webapp.
- `schema/`
  - contains DB migration files

#### HTML Page Layout

Keep in mind we want all pages to "work" when viewed directly in a web browser, without a web server.
This is only a challenge so much that the path to resources on the file system needs to match
what the path would be on the webserver.

For example, a page might be at path: "/page/details/data"
If that page references a "../details.css", that CSS page needs to be in "/page/details/details.css"

The issue is that the path on the server does not have to match the file system, the server
path "/page/details/data" could easily map to a template page located at "/page/data.html"

So, we really want every page when opened via web browser, without a web server,
to have fully functioning CSS & JS. To do this, we need to carefully line up paths.

### Env Variables

Configuration values are in 'application.properties'.
The config values all have defaults and will work out of the box.
To override config values, set the appropriate environment variables in IntelliJ,
launch configuration. It will look something like this:

### Code Organization - DAO's and Controllers

Controller classes are classic spring webserver endpoints. Controller
methods should handle control flow and ideally get actions done
by calling functional private static methods or DAO methods.

Controller's and packages are organized by functionality. 

If a controller is 'tight', pretty small and straight forward,
then the DB access methods might sometimes be directly in the controller.
Otherwise usually DB access code will be in an adjacent "DAO" class.

### Code Formatting

Use google-java-format Intellij plugin.

Formatting can be applied with gradle 'spotless' plugin: `./gradlew spotlessApply`


### Writing unit tests

- all DB queries should be tested in isolation.
- controller logic is ideally tested end-to-end, invoke the controller
  endpoint with a JSON or Map payload and then validate you
  get the right response and/or that the DB changes appropriately
- it's okay to write simple DB queries in the test code to validate
  the system behavior.

### System Authentication

A user is logged in if they have an auth cookie that contains
the correct secret value. There is a RequestInterceptor that
checks a requested URLs prefix and then checks for that cookie
if the URL requires authentication.

The magic cookie value is set by environment variable on startup.
If the cookie value matches, it is valid, otherwise there is
a redirect to the login page.

-----

In the future, it is intended to have individual logins. In which
case the correct cookie value will be a value stored in database.
After a user logs in, we would store a token value in DB,
then we'd check the DB for this token value.

## Deployment

- git push to master
- docker image is automatically built
- ssh to server
- run any psql migrations:
  - `sudo -u postgres psql; \c wnc_helene;`
- run `/root/redeploy.sh`
